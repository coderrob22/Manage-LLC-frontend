# Manage, LLC
Front end design to client (Manage, LLC) business' website

**Link to project:** https://coderrob22.github.io/Manage-LLC-frontend/



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & Tailwind

I got the logo from the company and the color scheme is based off of the client's logo. I used tailwind for the front end design because of the built in features that come with the css framework.

## Optimizations

When I have time i'd love to go back and finish the other pages of the project. I am also planning to add a backend, probably php w/laravel as the server with REST api's. I may also go back and change the testimonials section into a carousel where the testimonials are all spinning 5 seconds apart.

## Lessons Learned:

Using Tailwind for this client project was very efficient. Although all the classes are listed in the html that didn't feel overwhelming for me. I will definitely use this framework again.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
